# OmnichannelAuthValidator

This is a super simple validator for auth chat used in Dynamics 365 Omnichannel.

Change the PublicKeyURL and Token to the values you have configured in your authentication settings. Build and run the project. 
If it passes without any exceptions, your key and token are good.
